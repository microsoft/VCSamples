In fact, the business logic in this case does simple arithmetic (geometric, harmonic, and quadratic mean calculations), returning the result to the client. </p><p>It is a better programming practice to separate business logic from the scaffolding that exposes that business logic (COM in this case). However, this sample assumes that the business logic has been implemented directly within the COM object that will be consumed and that there is no access to the underlying business logic except by going through this COM object.</p><p>The sample creates a wrapper DLL that consumes the COM object via <b>#import</b> and exposes a .NET Framework class to be consumed by .NET Framework clients. This is done by defining a native C++ class, <code>nativeMeanCalc</code>, which contains a COM smart pointer data member brought in through <b>#import</b>. A .NET Framework class is defined that contains a pointer to the native C++ class. The .NET Framework class, <code>netMeanCalc</code>, contains a pointer to a <code>nativeMeanCalc</code> object, which completes the pathway to the destination COM object. <code>netMeanCalc</code> is the public class that the .NET Framework clients will consume.</p><p>There are two client projects:  </p><ul><li><p><code>nativeClient</code> is a COM client and is implemented in native C++. </p></li><li><p><code>netClient</code> is written using C++/CLI.</p></li></ul></div><h1 class="heading">Classes and Keywords</h1><div id="sectionSection2" class="seeAlsoNoToggleSection"><p>This sample demonstrates the following keywords:</p><p>__gc; #using; #import; try; catch; _com_error; Console::WriteLine</p></div></div><div id="footer"><div class="footerLine"></div>
