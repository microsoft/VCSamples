The server object receives data through its dual interface <b>Send</b> method and transmits it to all connected components through the <b>Transfer</b> event on its dispatch interface.</p><p>The client is an ActiveX control that contains a server object. The control responds to the <b>Transfer</b> event fired by the server object. It has a dual interface that has <b>Connect</b>, <b>Send</b>, and <b>Disconnect</b> methods. If the <b>Transfer</b> event is fired with a variant containing a BSTR, the string is displayed in the center of the control.</p></div><h1 class="heading">Keywords</h1><div id="sectionSection2" class="seeAlsoNoToggleSection"><p>This sample uses the following keywords:</p><p>#import; CComAutoThreadModule; CComSimpleThreadAllocator; CoCreateInstance; DECLARE_CLASSFACTORY_AUTO_THREAD(); FireViewChange</p></div></div><div id="footer"><div class="footerLine"></div>
