What Is This Thing?


This is a sample OCX control that demonstrates how to use the help files generated for you by the Microsoft Developer Studio Control Wizard. This sample OCX also demonstrates how to use tooltips in an OCX control. At runtime, the control is capable of displaying a tooltip for itself and showing help for itself in response to help messages being sent to it, usually as a result of the user pressing F1 while the control has the focus. The control just displays 3 strings in its client area. The text for these strings is entered in the General  property page for this control. OCX controls can be embedded in a client application to perform some specific task. Using OCX controls, a developer can add functionality to their program simply by embedding an OCX control, saving them from having to actually write the code required to add the desired functionality to their program.


This control also enables the Help button for the container’s properties dialog box if it is supplied by the container. Pressing the property dialog help button will display this help file.
