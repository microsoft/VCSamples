You can browse to any location on the Web, enter data in forms, print Web pages, download files, or open files on your local hard drive. New addresses can be entered manually in the Address bar of the <b>CReBar</b> control, or hypertext links can be clicked on in the main view.</p><p>The sample demonstrates the ease in which a Web browsing capability can be inserted into any application. Most of the functionality of <b>CHtmlView</b> is trivial to implement (for example, <b>GoHome</b> or <b>GoBack</b>), although some of the less obvious features such as printing and font sizing have been implemented for your convenience. The MFCIE sample also demonstrates the proper method of retrieving and reading the Favorites selections and displays them in their own menu.</p><p>One thing to note is that the Web browser control used by <b>CHtmlView</b> does its own printing internally, so MFC's printing and Print Preview methods are bypassed entirely.</p><div class="alert"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><th align="left">Security Note </th></tr><tr><td><p>This sample code is provided to illustrate a concept and should not be used in applications or Web sites, as it may not illustrate the safest coding practices.</p></td></tr></table></div><h1 class="heading">Building and Running the Sample</h1><div id="sectionSection0" class="seeAlsoNoToggleSection"><h4 class="subHeading">To build and run the MFCIE sample</h4><div class="subSection"><ol><li><p>Open the solution mfcie.sln.</p></li><li><p>On the <b>Build</b> menu, click <b>Build</b>.</p></li><li><p>Run the MFCIE application.</p></li></ol></div><p>MFCIE assumes that you are already connected to the Internet. When it first starts, it will open your home page and you can browse from there just as you would with Microsoft Internet Explorer, either by using the Address bar, the Favorites menu, or by following links on the current page.</p></div><h1 class="heading">Keywords</h1><div id="sectionSection1" class="seeAlsoNoToggleSection"><p>This sample demonstrates the following keywords:</p><p>CToolBarCtrl::SetButtonWidth; CToolBarCtrl::SetHotImageList; CToolBarCtrl::SetImageList; CReToolBar::SetButtons; CReToolBar::SetButtonInfo; CReToolBar::SetButtonText; CReBar::AddBar; CHtmlView::Navigate2; CAnimateCtrl::Play; CAnimateCtrl::Stop; CAnimateCtrl::Seek; CComboBoxEx::InsertItem; CHtmlView::GoHome; CHtmlView::GoBack; CHtmlView::GoForward; CHtmlView::GoSearch; CHtmlView::Stop; CHtmlView::Refresh; CHtmlView::ExecWB</p><div class="alert"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><th align="left">Note </th></tr><tr><td><p>Some samples, such as this one, have not been modified to reflect the changes in the Visual C++ wizards, libraries, and compiler, but still demonstrate how to complete your desired task. </p></td></tr></table></div></div></div><div id="footer"><div class="footerLine"></div>
