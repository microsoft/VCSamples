CDINFO

The CD Info sample draws a pie chart representing the length of
tracks off the audio CD that is in the drive. It uses the Media
Control Interface (MCI) APIs to retrieve this information. The
sample also demonstrates how to use the tooltip common control
to implement tooltips for your control. The tooltip displays
the track length for the track represented by the pie chart
segment that the cursor is over.

The CDInfo.htm file demonstrates the use of the control from
Internet Explorer.

The control implements the following Methods
Read:

	drive and displays the information in the form of a pie chart.
Redraw:

	control also rotates the pie chart so that the played
	track will be at the top.
