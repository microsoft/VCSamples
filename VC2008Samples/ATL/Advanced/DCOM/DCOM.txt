DCOM Sample

This sample demonstrates how to call a COM object implemented in an NT service from
multiple clients running on different machines. It is composed of the following parts:

1.DrawServ - This is the NT service that implements the COM object.
2.ATLDraw  - This is the client that connects to the DrawServ COM object.
3.DrawCtl  - This is a control version of ATLDraw. It has a Connect method (that takes
             a machine name string parameter), and a Disconnect method.

Instructions

Note that for this sample to work all machines must be running NT 4.0 Beta 2 or later.

1. Build the DrawServ and ATLDraw samples.

2. Copy the DRAWSERV.EXE and ATLDRAW.EXE to each machine that you want to run the sample
   from. Register the server on each machine by running DrawServ with the command-line
   argument /RegServer or -RegServer (case-insensitive), for example, DrawServ /RegServer.
   (REGISTER.DLL must be registered for this to work.) The reason you must copy the server
   to each client is because the CLSID for the server and the server type library need to
   be registered on the client.

3. Start the service on the server by using the Services icon in Control Panel.

4. Using DCOMCNFG on each client, select the Properties of the DrawServ Class. From the
   Location tab select "Run application on the following computer", then enter the name of
   the computer that you are running the server object on. Uncheck the "Run application on
   this computer" box.

5. Run ATLDRAW and select Server.Connect from the menu on each client. Draw on the client
   window by holding the left mouse button down and dragging a line. The drawn line should
   appear on each client that is also connected to the same server. You can also use the
   View.Color menu option to change the color for each client.
