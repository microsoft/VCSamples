With this dialog box, the user enters the number of threads to use to read through the table. When the user clicks the <b>Run</b> button, <b>ReadRecords</b> in DBRead.h is called to open the database, session, and table, and to create the necessary number of threads. As it opens the table, the function sets the <b>DBPROP_CANHOLDROWS</b> property to true so that the provider allows the user to retrieve new rows without releasing the previously retrieved rows. This capability is required, because multiple threads retrieve new rows as other threads are still processing their current threads.</p><p>The sample also shows how to extend the standard <b>CRowset</b> class by creating a new <code>CMyRowset</code> class, which derives from <b>CRowset</b>, and adds the <code>MoveAndProcess</code> member function. The start routine of each thread is the <code>ReadTable</code> function and the table class is passed to this function. The function calls the routine <code>MoveAndProcess</code> to read through each record. Note that the accessor class <code>CProduct</code> is defined so that the data will not be retrieved automatically on the <code>MoveNext</code> call. This avoids buffer conflicts with the other threads, and there is no need to protect <code>MoveNext</code> with a critical section. The <code>MoveAndProcess</code> function calls <code>MoveNext</code>, and then calls <code>GetDataHere</code> to place the data directly into a local variable of that function. <code>ProcessRecord</code> is called for each record retrieved and the function simply traces out the values of the record by default.</p><p>Each thread counts the number of records it reads, and those are traced out at the end, along with a total and time taken, which is displayed on the dialog box.</p><div class="alert"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><th align="left">Note </th></tr><tr><td><p>   The MultiRead sample reads the MultiRead.mdb database file.
