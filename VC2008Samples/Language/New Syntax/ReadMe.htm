These features are primarily added to support .NET and expose capabilities of the CLR. The sample presents short snippets of code for each language feature, which shows common ways to use the C++ syntax. The sample is meant to be built and run. For best results, using debugger breakpoints to walk through the code will help with understanding how new C++ features work.</p><div class="alert"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><th align="left">Security Note </th></tr><tr><td><p>This sample code is provided to illustrate a concept and should not be used in applications or Web sites, as it may not illustrate the safest coding practices.</p></td></tr></table></div><h1 class="heading">To build and run this sample</h1><div id="procedureSection0" class="section"><ol><li><p>Open the solution file, C++ Language Samples.sln, in the Visual Studio development environment. </p></li><li><p>From the <b>Build</b> menu, click <b>Build Solution</b>.</p></li><li><p>From the <b>Debug</b> menu, click <b>Start</b>.</p></li></ol></div><h1 class="heading">Requirements</h1><div id="requirementsSection" class="section"></div><h1 class="heading">Demonstrates</h1><div id="demonstratesSection" class="section"><p>Generics, finalization, and partial template specialization.</p></div><h1 class="heading">How it Works</h1><div id="sectionSection0" class="seeAlsoNoToggleSection"><p>Each file in the sample shows off a new feature of the C++ language.
