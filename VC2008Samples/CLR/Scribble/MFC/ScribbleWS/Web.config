	<!-- DYNAMIC DEBUG COMPILATION
              Set compilation debug="true" to insert debugging symbols (.pdb information)
              into the compiled page. Because this creates a larger file that executes
              more slowly, you should set this value to true only when debugging and to
              false at all other times. For more information, refer to the documentation about
              debugging ASP.NET files.

    <!--  CUSTOM ERROR MESSAGES
          Set customError mode values to control the display of user-friendly 
          error messages to users instead of error details (including a stack trace):

          "On" Always display custom (friendly) messages  
          "Off" Always display detailed ASP.NET error information.
          "RemoteOnly" Display custom (friendly) messages only to users not running 
          on the local Web server. This setting is recommended for security purposes, so 
          that you do not display application detail information to remote clients.

          This section sets the authorization policies of the application. You can allow or deny access
          to application resources by user or role. Wildcards: "*" mean everyone, "?" means anonymous

          Application-level tracing enables trace log output for every page within an application. 
          Set trace enabled="true" to enable application trace logging.  If pageOutput="true", the
          trace information will be displayed at the bottom of each page.  Otherwise, you can view the 
          application trace log by browsing the "trace.axd" page from your web application
          root.

    <!--  SESSION STATE SETTINGS
          By default ASP.NET uses cookies to identify which requests belong to a particular session. 
          If cookies are not available, a session can be tracked by adding a session identifier to the URL. 
          To disable cookies, set sessionstate cookieless="true".
